Jon Snow receives a valuable sword from Mormont and lives a dilemma to make a choice of helping Robb or stay with the Night's Watch and to live with the consequences for the rest of his life. The infection in the wound of Drogo makes him weak and Daenerys summons the witch to heal him. She tells that a life must be sacrificed in exchange and she kills Drogo's horse. The Lannister army attacks Robb's army and discovers that Robb lured them, leaving only two thousand men behind, while eighteen thousand men have attacked Jaime's army and made him prisoner. Arya sees her father being brought chained in front of the crowd and falsely confessing his treason to save Sansa and Arya. However Joffrey betrays the deal and Ned is beheaded.\n",

I do not believe that the witch is making a spell to heal Drogo since he slaughtered her people. My guess is that the life in exchange per Drogo's life will be his unborn child. Joffrey is probably the most despicable character so far. My vote is ten."
